# EOSC-HUB ICOS-LTER CC Use case: R-based ensemble outlier analysis publicly available as REST API-based web-service

The measurement of any environmental parameter and the detection of outliers within the time
series are closely linked and of particular importance, as outliers may have detrimental effects on the
further analysis of these data. However, the definition of an outlier is - until now - controversely
discussed and thus not extactly defined. As to the importance of the this topic in science, multiple
methods have been implemented to successfully detect and eliminate outliers in a data set.
The present use case aims to implement an R-based ensemble outlier analysis publicly available as
REST API-based web-service processing time series of environmental data stored either in a Sensor
Observation Sevice (SOS) or a cloud-based data repository. 

This is work in progress
