This repository contains the code for the eLTER prototype outlier analysis service created during the EOSC-HUB project (https://www.eosc-hub.eu/) 

This work is co-funded by the EOSC-hub project (Horizon 2020) under Grant number 777536.   

Reference: Goldfarb, D., Kobler, J. and Peterseil, J. (2020) Providing a user-friendly outlier analysis service implemented as open REST API. EGU2020-14903. https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-14903.html

# Basic information

This service prototype is based on a python-flask server stub automatically generated from an [OpenAPI Specification yaml file](swagger_server/swagger/swagger.yaml) via the online [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/). See the section below for further information about the generation and how to start the server.

Requests to the flask server trigger the respective procedures in the [default controller](swagger_server/controllers/default_controller.py), which call R-code performing the actual work. The latter can be found in the outlier_script folder and is divided into several functional modules represented as separate R-Scripts. The entry point is the script [quality_check.R](outlier_script/quality_check.R) which retrieves the data to be analyzed from [file repositories](outlier_script/getFile.R) or from [SOS](outlier_script/getSos.R), which uses 52Â°North's [sos4R library](https://github.com/52North/sos4R) for that purpose. The actual outlier analysis is performed in the file [outlierAnalysis.R](outlier_script/outlierAnalysis.R).

# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m swagger_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/ui/
```

Your Swagger definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/swagger.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t swagger_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 swagger_server
```
